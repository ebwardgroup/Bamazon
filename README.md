# Bamazon
Amazon-like storefront using MySQL 

## Overview
Bamazon is an online store where you can buy a few very common household items.  Enter the item ID from the list of available products, and you will be asked how much of that item you'd like to buy.  Then the app will give you the cost.  Once you run the program again, the inventory will be updated to reflect what you just bought.
